# CAESER-CIPHER
Caesar cipher shift is the number of positions by which each letter in a text is shifted to encrypt or decrypt it. For example, a shift of 3 would mean that each letter is replaced by the letter three positions ahead in the alphabet. So, "a" would become "d," "b" would become "e," and so on.
